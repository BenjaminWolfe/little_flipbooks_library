# Little flipbooks library

The incremental code/result reveal provided by flipbooks may help you digest longer snippets code including pipelines and ggplot builds.  Since developing the code-parsing code that allows flipbooking (with Emi Tanaka and Garrick Aden-Buie), I've produced many little books, that don't all seem like they need their own github repository.  So they live here together:  

- [Galton Board](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/galton_board/galton_board.html#1)
- [leaflet for R (interactive maps)](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/leaflet/leaflet#1)
- [ggplot themes](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/taming_themes_in_ggplot/taming_ggplot_themes.html)
- [racing barchart](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/racing_bars/racing_barcharts.html)
- [#tidytuesday highlights](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/tidytuesday_highlights/tidytuesday_highlights.html)
- [easing gallery for gganimate](https://evamaerey.github.io/easing_gganimate/easing_examples.html)


Would you like to make a flipbook? You can start here:

- [minimal example (tidytuesday data - recommended)](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/tidytuesday_minimal_example/tidytuesday_minimal_example)

Other examples that are pretty minimal:

- [minimal example (gapminder data)](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/minimal_example/minimal_example) -- shows example of incremental reveal without code reveal
- [checkerboard](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/checkerboard/checkerboard.html)
